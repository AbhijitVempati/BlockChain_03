# BlockChain_03

1) I have deployed a smart contract using the truffle IDE in the network and testnet for this particular homework assignment. I initially configured the truffle before deploying a Dapp that automatically executes events and actions.
2) I loaded up my goerli account with 0.1 Ethereum and used it to deploy the code on the testnet. Prior to Q4, they discontinued service for the ropsten endpoints they had been using.
3) So I made the choice to use the Goerli, using it as both a faucet to top the local address and an endpoint for the testnet. Additionally, it engaged with the regional blockchain.
4) I used the truffle IDE for developing, migrating, testing, and console. Utilizing the node, a secret key was created for the testnet and used as the menomic.
5) Followed the instructions for building a smart contract, from the initial deployment of the test code to the testnet to the basic initialization of the folders with the pre-loaded files.
